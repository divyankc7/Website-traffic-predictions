# Website-traffic-predictions
Developed an ARIMA model to predict the traffic on a website using Statsmodel package. Also developed an auto-ARIMA model using the pmdarima library. Finally evaluated the two models using different metrics like mean absolute error, root mean squared error and mean absolute percentage error. ARIMA fitted manually outperformed the auto-ARIMA model.
